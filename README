The code has been adapted to run on Linux and it uses only C99 (not C++).
To build the program, the library ncurses has to be installed on your system.
To install ncurses on a Debian based Linux distribution, enter:
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

To build the program, just enter:
$ make
To run it afterwards, enter:
$ ./main
